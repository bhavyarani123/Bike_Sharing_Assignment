# Project Name
> Bike Sharing Assignment:
This assignment is a programming assignment wherein we have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.

They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands
Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.

## General Information
- This assignment is a programming assignment wherein we have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
-We have modeled the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
